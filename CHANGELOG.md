# Changelog

All notable changes to capsule-viewer's published packages, the npm package
`@action-state-group/capsule-viewer` (`ts/`) and the Go module
`github.com/action-state-group/capsule-viewer/go` (`go/`), are documented
here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it reaches 1.0.

## Unreleased

### Added

- The page emitter and presentation builder, moved from agent-action-capsule
  (agent-action-capsule#281) and still pinned to the same Go/TypeScript
  byte-parity goldens and CSP hashes:
  - Go: package `github.com/action-state-group/capsule-viewer/go/emitter`,
    the former `github.com/action-state-group/agent-action-capsule/go/emitter`,
    with the same API. It depends on agent-action-capsule's Go module v0.8.0.
  - TypeScript: `emitEvidenceGraphHtml`, `buildPresentation`,
    `offlineHtmlFromFragment` and the rest of agent-action-capsule's
    `emitter.ts` and `presentation-builder.ts` exports, from the package
    root. The in-browser renderer (`renderEvidenceGraph`) ships bundled as
    `dist/evidence-graph.iife.js`. Bundle verification comes from
    `@action-state-group/agent-action-capsule` 0.1.1, now a dependency, along
    with `@action-state-group/cll`, which that version needs to load.
- The moved files keep their BSD-3-Clause license (`ts/LICENSE-BSD-3-Clause`,
  `go/emitter/LICENSE`).

## ts 0.0.0

A placeholder, published by hand so npm could take a trusted publisher. It
holds no code; see RELEASING.md, "Registry configuration".
